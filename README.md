# blast_muscle_PROSITE
This is my programme developed as my Final Proyect for the subject Programming for bioinformatics.

The main objective of the Final Proyect for the subject Programming for bioinformatics was to create a programme that could analyse one or more sequences (given in fasta format). This programme had to do a blast between the sequences given and the sequences forming the genbank (or genbanks) also given. And with this result it should do a muscle alignment, a phylogenetic tree (Neighbor-Joining) and also identify all the PROSITE domains in the sequences.
